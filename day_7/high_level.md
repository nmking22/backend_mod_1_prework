## High Level Notes

### Checker Board
1. The first thing to note with this problem is that we'll need to define a method to perform our task. The method should have one parameter (size), which refers to the length, width or height of our board (they are all the same since the board is a square). `def checkerboard(size)` sounds good to me.
1. To build our board, we'll have to print a number of lines, designated by the argument provided in our parameter. These lines will **not** all be the same, though. Half of our lines will start with `"X"`, while the other half will start with `" "` (okay, maybe not exactly half if our `size` is odd). This means that we'll have to use iterations and a conditional statement to signify which lines should start with which characters. I think a good solution would be to take advantage of the `even?` and `odd?` methods here, since we are already working with integers. We can use the `each` method to go through every number starting with our `size` argument and descending to 1. Then, we can use an `if` statement to query whether we're on an even or odd line, and then activate the desired printout based on the boolean result of `even?` or `odd?`.
1. This solution is definitely on the right track, but provides a new problem to solve: our `size` argument is an integer, but our `each` method requires an array. Fortunately, this is an easy fix. We can define an array in our `checkerboard(size)` method that converts our `size` integer into an array. To do this, we'll use the `downto` method with an argument of 1, as well as the `to_a` method. This combination will convert our `size` integer into an array that begins with `size` and descends to 1. Something like `size_array = size.downto(1).to_a` should do the trick.
1. Next, we'll have to iron out our printouts, so our board looks just right. `" X" * (size / 2)` and `"X " * (size / 2)` will work here. We only want to print half of our `size` on each line since we're using two characters in our multiplied string. We can add `+ "\n"` to the end of each of our printouts so that each of our lines prints out on a separate line instead of all on one line.
1. We'll have to fix one last problem before we're done. Our printouts work great when our `size` is even, but what about when our `size` is odd? Can ruby multiply strings by floats (ex: does `"X " * 3.5 => "X X X X"`?)? Unfortunately, no. After a little trial and error, it looks like ruby rounds our float down to an integer. We can fix this with another `if` statement that checks if our `size` is even. When our size is odd, we can just add `+ "X"` or `+ " "` to our printouts to make it work.
