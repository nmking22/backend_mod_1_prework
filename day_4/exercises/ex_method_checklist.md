## Method Checklist

1. `def` is always the first code in creating a function.
1. `method_name` follows `def` - method names should always be in snake_case.
1. `(paramater/s)` follow `method_name` - more than one paramater can be set by separating each parameter with a `,`, but each parameter must be unique. Parameters should be relevant to increase the legibility of the code.
1.  The body of the method begins on the following line. The body should always be indented two spaces.
1. `end` must be included on the last line of the method to signify the end of the method. `end` should have the same indentation as `def`.
